# react-web-setup
Spend more time on coding than on setting up project.
react-web-setup setup react project and tests very easily for you.

## Setting up React app:
```
npm react-web-setup <app-name>
```

It will ask you few questions?
1. Which testing framework to use [react-testing-library or enzyme]
2. Should test coverage be included?
3. Should initialize as git repository

After answering questions it will create your repository
And *bammn!* you are ready to code!!

Happy coding :)
